      <div class="Javascript">
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          I started my coding journey with TypeScript, but then understood that
          I should learn JavaScript first! What I have learned down below.

        <tr>
          <td>
            <li>Strings</li>
            <li>Loops (tough one)</li>
            <li>functions</li>
            <li>syntax</li>
            <li>objects</li>
            <li>classes</li>
            <li>and more....</li>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </div>
      <div class="HTML">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        I have learned HTML as well and I kinda understand it. Probably know
        maybe 3% :D.
      </div>
      <div class="CSS">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
          CSS is the least language that I know. And I actually really struggle
          with it, because I just can't get the freaking "div's" horizontally
          and then I get them horizontally, but not right enough and then I try
          to correct everything......... and then it just gets worse and
          worse....... and then I quit and rage :D. Also all the styles are hard
          to remember.
